Our project "Deep Learning-Based Signal Classification Using RTL-SDR and Convolutional Neural Networks" It aims to automate RF signal classification, which traditionally requires manual feature extraction and is inefficient for real-time applications. Using CNNs, the project seeks to classify various modulation types (like AM, FM, and BPSK) by learning features automatically from spectrograms, thus enhancing accuracy and scalability.
